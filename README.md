# BD-ImgPickr
Adds a tab (or maybe just a new section idk) to the discord emote picker that lets you choose from a list of user-specified custom images to post. Mainly intended to be used for emotes.

Dev plan: Figure out how the FreeEmoji plugin handles the image link posting stuff and kinda just steal all of that lmao
